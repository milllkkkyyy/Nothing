# Nothing
A school project

Every asset is handmade in Microsoft Paint and then adjusted in Adobe Photoshop. 
I use photoshop to scale and make objects transparent. The goal of this game is to finish it by the end of
december. The project itself isn't very complicated as I have the Godot Addon Dialogic which handles everything
I need it to do. 

Why am I doing this?

Its not only for school. I just want to make something I can smile at and be proud of. 
I have made a game in the past that I was happy with but not really proud of. However, truthfully, I also want other people to
fell like they can just hop into things and just make somthing without limitaions of their skill. I suck at a lot of things
and I feel like there are people who are amazing at the things I can't do, 
but because they're scared and for whatever reason they come up with,they don't do it.
Im using MS paint a couple hours of my free time every now and then to make something I can be proud of. I'm
hoping others can follow my footsteps, make somthing better than I could even imagine and be proud of it. 

I am also doing this to require myslef to make readible code that can be edited upon or understood. I and probably many
other programmers have faced an issue were they arent able to read code sent by a friend and cannot help. While godots language helps
a lot with readibility, I want a project that I could share my code to someone who knows very little and they can understand it
as much as their prior knowledge about computer sceience allows them to. 

These are video updates I am doing for myself:
