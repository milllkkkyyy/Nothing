# Nothing
A school project

Every asset is handmade in Microsoft Paint and then adjusted in Adobe Photoshop. 
I use photoshop to scale and make objects transparent. The goal of this game is to finish it by the end of
december. The project itself isn't very complicated as I have the Godot Addon Dialogic which handles everything
I need it to do. 

These are video updates I am doing for myself:
