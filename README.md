# Nothing
A school project

Every asset is handmade in Microsoft Paint and then adjusted in Adobe Photoshop. 
I use photoshop to scale and make objects transparent. The goal of this game is to finish it by the end of
december. The project itself isn't very complicated as I have the Godot Addon Dialogic which handles everything
I need it to do. 

#Why am I doing this?

Its not only for school. I just want to make something I can smile at and be proud of. 
I have made a game in the past that I was happy with but not really proud of. However, truthfully, I also want other people to
fell like they can just hop into things and just make somthing without limitaions of their skill. I suck at a lot of things
and I feel like there are people who are amazing at the things I can't do, 
but because they're scared and for whatever reason they come up with,they don't do it.
Im using MS paint a couple hours of my free time every now and then to make something I can be proud of. I'm
hoping others can follow my footsteps, make somthing better than I could even imagine and be proud of it.
